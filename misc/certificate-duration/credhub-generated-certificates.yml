# By default Credhub will accept any minimum duration for certificates. Setting this value will overwrite the lifetime of certificates to at least the configured values.
# This can be used in cases where environments need longer living certificates to avoid writing ops files for every single certificate.
# This does NOT affect the certificates that the director vm uses, for those you need the other ops files
# As the Director uses 365 days by default this will only have an effect if you want more than those 365 days.
